# RNN-LSTM-Cryptocurrency

## Overview

This project focuses on cryptocurrency price prediction using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. By analyzing historical market trends and price data, the goal is to build models that can forecast cryptocurrency prices with a high degree of accuracy.

## Features

- **LSTM Model:** Utilizes LSTM architecture for time-series analysis and prediction of cryptocurrency prices.

- **Data Set:** Uses historical cryptocurrency price data from reliable sources.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares the data for model training, including MinMax scaling and sequence generation.

- **Model Training:** Trains LSTM modelson the preprocessed data for 50 epochs to learn patterns and trends in cryptocurrency prices.

- **Visualization and Plotting:** Includes tools for visualizing historical data, model predictions, and trends.

- **Loss Calculation:** Provides insights into model performance by calculating training and validation loss.

- **Price Forecasting:** Generates cryptocurrency price predictions for a specified future period.
